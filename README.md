# VSCode-StackOverflow

A neutral colour scheme, based on the theme of https://stackoverflow.com. Ported from Sublime Text to VSCode.

This is the dark theme, of course.

# Installation

1. Make sure you have VSCode installed.
2. Clone the GitHub repository OR download as zip file and decompress.
3. Move the folder that was just created to Users/USERNAME/.vscode/extensions on mac, and something similar on windows.
4. Go back into your Visual Studio Code window and open Preferences -> Color Theme, then search for 'StackOverflow'
5. Click on the option called 'StackOverflow' and it will set your VSCode theme.

# Information

This colour scheme was tested with python, but it works fine with any other language.
