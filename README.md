# VSCode-StackOverflow

A neutral colour scheme, based on the theme of https://stackoverflow.com. Ported from Sublime Text to VSCode.

This is the dark theme, of course.

# Installation

1. Make sure you have VSCode installed.
2. Go to the directory you cloned the repository.
3. Run 'code .'
4. After running, do **not** open any files. Press F5 to open a new window with the theme loaded.
5. Quit VSCode.
6. Re-launch VSCode, and the theme should be loaded, if not, go to Preferences -> Color Theme and select 'StackOverflow'

# Information

This colour scheme was tested with python, but it works fine with any other language.
